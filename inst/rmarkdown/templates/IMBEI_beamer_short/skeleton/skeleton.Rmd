\tableofcontents

# Section 1
## Subsection 1.1 : INTRO 
### About this Template 

* The markdown header offers many configuration options, most notably: 
  * the aspect ratio
  * font size 
  * the handout option, which removes all pauses for printouts
  * In the markdown option `header-includes`, you can include latex code in the 
latex header of the document. This is most helpful for latex packages or custom makros. 
Also, you can see there a line that adds tables of content of each section. If you don't like
them, just comment it out. 
* **TIP:** Place a logo with the name *Universitaetsmedizin.jpg* in the same 
folder as this .rmd-file. It will get used for header and titlepage. 

## Subsection 1.2: Layout Tips: Lists, Columns, etc 

### About Lists

Lists can be done with either markdown or with latex:  

\begin{itemize}
\item this is 
\item a \textbf{list}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item this is 
\item a \emph{tight} list
\end{itemize}

* This is also a 
* *tight* list. 


### Multicolumn Slides

Again, there is a latex and a markdown option to create multicolumn slides. 
I usually prefer markdown, because it is easier to include r-code (or anything that is not 
latex code) in  those columns. 

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
* This is just a list
  * even with subitems :)
* Look!
* on the right side is a plot!
:::

::: {.column}
```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(-1:1,-1:1,type="n")
text(0,0,  "Hi, I'm a R-plot on a multicolumn slide,",cex=2)
text(0,-.2,"the `::::::` are needed to make that happen. ",cex=2)
```

# Section 2
### Slide C

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(-1:1,-1:1,type="n")
text(0,0," ... maybe another plot ... ",cex=4)
```
