# Section 1 : Usage Tips
## Subsection 1.1 : About this Template  
### About this Template 

* This is a template for `R`-markdown beamer presentations. It gives an overview 
on how to use this template, but it assumes you are familiar with R-markdown in gerenal. 
* I use this template for my own presentations, you are invited to use it as well :) 
* If you have suggestions/questions, please feel free to write me an e-mail: pmildenb@uni-mainz.de
\vskip12pt
* **TIP:** Place a logo with the exact name *Universitaetsmedizin.jpg* in the same 
folder as this .rmd-file. It will be used as logo for header and titlepage. 


### Configuration options

**Configuration options in he YAML header**  
The YAML header is the part of this R-markdown file at the very top, between the 
`---`.  
There you can configure 

* the aspect ratio
* font size 
* the separation between (markdown) list items
* the handout option, which removes all pauses (mainly useful for printouts)
* In the markdown option `header-includes`, you can include latex code in the 
latex header of the document. This is most helpful for latex packages or custom makros.
*  Also, you can see there a line (` - \AtBeginSection [...]` ) that adds 
tables of content of each section. If you don't like them, just comment it out. 

## Subsection 1.2: Lists

### About Lists

Lists can be done with either **markdown** or with \textbf{\LaTeX}  


\vskip12pt  

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
__with \LaTeX__
\begin{itemize}
\item this is
\item a \textbf{list}
\item with standard spacing between items
\end{itemize}

\vskip1cm

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item this is a \emph{tight} list
\item which we get 
\item by adding the \texttt{\\tightlist} command
\end{itemize}
:::

::: {.column}
**`R`-markdown**

* You get the markdown equivalent

* by simply leaving an empty line

* between each list item in the .rmd-file.

\vskip1cm

* But by default markdown produces *tight* lists. 
* You can change the default separation 
* of markdown lists in the YAML header


:::
::::::


### Custom list spacing

* As seen above, the default for `r`-markdown lists are thight lists. 
* I've added an extra variable in the YAML header, called `tightlistSeparation`.
* It denotes the separation of list items in `pt`, the default is `0pt`. If you change it to e.g. your font size, you get lists with double spacing. 
* This variable makes global changes, if you wanted to change it for only one 
specific list, you might want to resort to latex directly ... (?)


### More About (Markdown) Lists 

1. Usual Markdown allows enumerated lists, 
2. like this one. 
3. All you need to do, is to start the line with `1.`, `...`

A) `R`-Markdown also enables you to use lettered (alphabetical) lists, 
B) for this you have to start the line with `A)`. 
C) It also works with small letters (trust me :) )


### Incremental Lists

Again, there's a latex way and a markdown way to do this. 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item With \LaTeX  lists, 
  \item you just need to add the \texttt{[<+->]} option to the itemize environment
\end{itemize}

> * with markdown lists, each list needs to start with `> *` 
> * or `> 1.` / `>a)` to get an ordered/alphabetical incemental list

\pause 

#### `\pause` command 
My personal favourite is to place the **`\pause`** from latex exactly where it fits best,
possibly between the third and fourth item of a list. 

  
## Subsection 1.3: Columns

### Multicolumn Slides

Again, there is a \LaTeX and a markdown option to create multicolumn slides. 
I usually prefer markdown, because it is easier to include r-code 
(or anything that is not latex code) in  those columns. 
  
:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* This is just a list
  * even with subitems :)
* Look!
* on the right side is a plot!

\vskip12pt 
**And please note that the width of the columns is adjustable by using width="XY%"** 
:::

::: {.column width="59%"}
\vskip-1cm
```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(-1:1,-1:1,type="n")
text(0,0,  "Hi, I'm a R-plot on a multicolumn slide,", cex=2)
text(0,-.2,"the `::::::` are needed to make that happen. ", cex=2)
```

## Section 1.4: Usage of the hash sign `#` 

### Hierachy with the hash sign `#`

* `#`   :   start of a new sections
* `##`  :   start of a new subsections
* `###` :   start of a new frame (i.e. slide)
  * You could readjust the slide level in the YAML header, but there is good reason not to. 
* `####`:   Infoboxes, like below: 

#### This is a box 
with some text

## Markdown
### `R`- Markdown

The go-to resource for `R`-markdown, which is a extended version of base markdown,  is considered to be  [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).  
**But**: 

\vskip-10pt

* It does not cover every feature of base markdown or even the PANDOC extensions to base markdown. For this, one might need to dig deeper, the PANDOC manual mentioned below is quite good.[^1] 
* E.g. lettered lists (see above) are a Pandoc extension

[^1]: when an `.rmd` is rendered (syn. knitted),`knitr` converts the `.rmd` into an `.md` file which Pandoc then converts into `.tex`. Then `.tex` into `.pdf` with a Latex-distribution, possibly `tinytex`. Since Pandoc handles the .md file, all Pandoc extensions can be used in `.rmd` files.

Other `R`-Markdown sources are

* The rmarkdown cheatsheet: \small [https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rmarkdown.pdf](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rmarkdown.pdf)



### PANDOC

**PANDOC** is a universal document converter that is used in every .rmd-file (and not only there).
It understands an extended and slightly revised version of base Markdown syntax.
